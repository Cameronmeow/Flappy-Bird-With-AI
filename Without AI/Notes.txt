We will increase score only if bird has passed the right side of the pipe 
we will add a trigger to know when the bird has passed the right side 
and a trigger to when the bird has entered the pipe i.e passed the left hand side

why left hand side because otherwise the score will keep on increasing if it is the right hand side of any pipe
so basically we wont increase the counter if the left hand side of bird is the right hand side of the pipe while simultaneosly
the bird's right side being behind the left hand side of a pipe
